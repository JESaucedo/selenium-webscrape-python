The Rock That Wanted to be a Tree
0:00
there once was a rock that wanted to be
0:01
a tree if I could be a tree he thought
0:05
it would be so much better than me
0:08
trees are big with branches long and
0:11
tall I am short and hard only a few
0:14
inches tall I could touch the clouds
0:16
feel the wind and sway and all the
0:18
children would come to swing and play so
0:22
he dug and he dug and planted himself in
0:24
covered in dirt waiting for a sprout to
0:27
begin but the grass nearby pointed and
0:30
mocked
0:31
what are you doing they laughed you dumb
0:33
silly rock I've planted myself the rock
0:37
said with some glee and I'll grow to
0:40
become a tree you'll see but they
0:43
laughed and laughed saying that's never
0:46
gonna be in the rock sat in the ground
0:49
covered in dirt embarrassed humiliated
0:52
and a little bit hurt then the rock
I Wish That Were Me
0:58
caught sight of the apples in the tree
0:59
and he thought to himself I wish that
1:02
were me day after day at their colors he
1:06
would gaze who would pick me he thought
1:08
painted in grace
1:11
finally he shouted this is how it'll be
1:14
I'm going to be an apple because the
1:17
rock just isn't me so the rock sat out
1:21
in the hot Summer Sun to try to see how
1:24
red he could become as the summer months
1:27
passed the hotter it got he stayed in
1:30
the heat till this rock was red-hot then
1:34
he rolled next to the apples that lay on
1:36
the ground to be picked to be chosen to
1:39
be selected to be found and when some
1:41
children came by Olivia Jesse and Jim
1:44
and they picked all the apples all the
1:46
apples but not him sad and alone he
1:52
thought all those apples up there in the
1:55
tree everyone likes them much more than
1:58
they like me so he sat and he sunk and a
2:01
frustrated funk thinking of nothing more
2:04
than a gray pile of junk
Blue Jay
2:09
later that day he heard singing from the
2:12
sky he lit up and saw Jay perched way up
2:16
high her song soothed the air her notes
2:19
filled the land and I'm quiet and
2:22
ordinary he thought ordinarily bland but
2:26
if I were a Jay a wonderful Luthi I'm
2:29
sure would be much better than me so he
2:34
built up some courage and climbed to a
2:36
spot and took a deep breath to show the
2:38
world what he's got out on a limb he
2:41
belted his song but sadly and badly this
2:44
song was just wrong his tune was
2:49
horribly terribly off-key it scared all
2:52
the Bears the bunnies the bees and all
2:54
the commotion he fell from the top
2:56
hitting every branch on his
2:58
flippity-flop drop now back in the dirt
3:03
just where he started sad and dejected
3:05
and a little brokenhearted surely he
3:09
thought surely it must be that a blue
3:12
jay is far far better than me then he
Radiant Fish
3:18
looked and he saw radiant fish swimming
3:20
below red ones blue ones striped and
3:23
yellow they zipped through the water
3:25
with grace and with ease I'm awkward and
3:28
slow
3:28
he thought I think you'd agree as he
3:32
gazed in wonder down at the creek he'd
3:34
occurred to him and he let out a shriek
3:35
surely he exclaimed a fish I could be a
3:39
fish a colorful fish is much better than
3:42
me so he rumbled and tumbled to the edge
3:47
in a flash and fell in the stream with a
3:49
big clumsy splash
3:51
he gurgled and gasp to swim on his own
3:54
but went one direction and sunk like a
3:57
stone from the bottom he lay in the cold
4:01
river bed looking up at the fish
4:03
together as they fed surely he thought
4:06
surely it must be that being a fish a
4:09
fish is far better than me so he dragged
4:16
himself out in the mud in a rage the
4:18
anger building as he ranted and raved
4:20
surely he sneered
4:22
anything would be anything would be
4:25
better than me then a voice from above
Little Rock
4:33
sounded below that echoed of kindness to
4:37
comfort his woe I watched as you toiled
4:41
struggled and labored wasting your days
4:44
to become those others he favoured first
4:48
he wished to be a tree do you remember
4:51
that this only got you soiled sneered
4:54
and laughed at next I recall a delicious
4:58
Apple in vain which led to nothing but
5:00
loneliness Aarti and pain followed by a
5:04
bird it was the song of the Jay and you
5:07
managed to scare every creature away
5:10
finally to be a fish you took a big dunk
5:13
which only left you angry upset and sunk
5:19
little rock little rock please can't you
5:22
see that for you being a rock is the
5:26
best thing you can be you looked into
5:30
the world and saw only what you were
5:32
missing
5:32
never once looking inside that all the
5:35
gifts you've been given when the earth
5:38
was created you were there to see steady
5:41
and solid forever you will be all the
5:45
gems and the rubies and the diamonds
5:47
you'll find come from your family your
5:49
brethren your kind
5:52
generations civilizations build with
5:55
your strength if they hope to survive
5:58
for any bit of length and when the
6:01
children came did you notice they each
6:04
climbed on your back for the apples to
6:06
reach and for those who were tired
6:09
traveled in week where else did they sit
6:12
for the rest they seek all the artwork
6:16
the sculptures the history negated
6:19
oh what a loss if you were never created
6:24
if we tried to be like everyone else it
6:28
would be such a shame because then
6:31
everyone in the world would all be just
6:34
the same so Little Rock Little Rock now
6:40
can you see there's nothing better than
6:42
being you which is what I created you to
6:45
be so from that day till this this may
6:51
come as a shock he found he was happiest
6:54
being simply a rock
